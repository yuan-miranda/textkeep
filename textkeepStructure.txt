TECHNICAL
	- Server has 8GiB of storage. (EC2)
	- Each accounts have a 128KiB storage for their text.
		that means 65,536 users could create an account.
		with each having that space. (Guests included)
	- Guests accounts will be deleted after 7 days of inactivity. (absolute)
		But they can create an texts with any durations.
		The Guest account is saved on localstorage, they need to open the
		site periodically.
	- We will not use any login via facebook or somesort, only email and password.
	- No annoying emails.
	- Obviously i dont know if this could run on EC2 but one thing for sure, it can
		run Doom.
	- Easter eggs!
